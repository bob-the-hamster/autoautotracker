# autoautotracker
A convenience wrapper for Ben "GreaseMonkey" Russell's
autotracker-bottomup.py random music generator tool 

Forked from:
autotracker-bottomup - the quite a few times more ultimate audio experience
by Ben "GreaseMonkey" Russell, 2011. Public domain.
https://github.com/wibblymat/ld24/blob/master/autotracker.py

Word lists derived from SCOWL https://github.com/kevina/wordlist.git

This fork does not provide any changes or improvements on music
generation, it is just a tool to make it easy to dump a plethora of
random .it files as a .zip and upload it somewhere.

My only substantial changes to autotracker.py are about random filename
generation. (to make them more random)
