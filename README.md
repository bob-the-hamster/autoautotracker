# autoautotracker
A convenience wrapper for Ben "GreaseMonkey" Russell's
autotracker-bottomup.py random music generator tool 

This does not provide any changes or improvements on music generation,
it is just a tool to make it easy to dump a plethora of random .it
files as a .zip and upload it somewhere.

My only substantial changes to autotracker.py are about random filename
generation. (to make them more random)
